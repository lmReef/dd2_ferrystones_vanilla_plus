Configurable in the REFramework script settings gui.

## Installation

Install with Fluffy Mod Manager as usual


## Known Issues
- Doesn't work with the Unmoored World specific permanent portcrystals as I haven't reached them for testing yet. I will add them when I can.
- Mods that give ferrystones unlimited uses will result in extra ferrystones being added to your inventory when teleporting to one the the permanent portcrystals
